# Unity Image Deformer

A Unity project for automatically generating deformations to a Unity scene. This is primarily useful for Machine Learning applications that are trying to generate synthetic data that will be used to feed into a model.

## Additional Notes

I originally used this package to generate thousands of images of Lego pieces when my original model wasn't generalizing very well. It worked surprisingly well to help generate a ton of data. Future plans include scripts to automatically set this up for Lego pieces.
